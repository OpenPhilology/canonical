				<div2 type="section" n="1"><head>OATH
					<p>I <hi rend="sc">SWEAR</hi> by Apollo Physician, by Asclepius, by
						Health, by Panacea and by all the gods and goddesses,
						making them my witnesses, that I will carry
						out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath
						and this indenture. To hold my teacher in this art
						equal to my own parents ; to make him partner in
						my livelihood ; when he is in need of money to
						share mine with him ; to consider his family as my
						own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they
						want to learn it, without fee or indenture ; to
						impart precept,<note>Apparently the written rules of the art, examples of
							which are to be found in several Hippocratie treatises.
							These books were not published in the strict sense of the
							word, but copies would be circulated among the members of
							the " physicians' union."</note> oral instruction, and all other
						instruction<note>Probably, in modern English, " instruction, written,
							oral
							and practical."</note> to my own sons, the sons of my
						teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken
						the physician's oath, but to nobody else. I will use
						treatment to help the sick according to my ability
						and judgment, but never with a view to injury and
						wrong-doing. Neither will I administer a poison to
						anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest
						such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman
						a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure
						and holy both my life and my art. I will not use
						the knife, not even, verily, on sufferers from stone,
						but I will give place to such as are craftsmen</p>
					<pb id="p.301"/>
					<p>therein. Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will
						enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all
						intentional wrong-doing and harm, especially from
						abusing the bodies of man or woman, bond or free.
						And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of
						my profession, as well as outside my profession in
						my intercourse with men,<note>This remarkable addition is worthy of a
							passing notice.
							The physician must not gossip, no matter how or where the
							subject-matter for gossip may have been acquired ; whether
							it be in practice or in private life makes no difference.</note> if it be what
						should not
						be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding
						such things to be holy secrets. Now if I carry out
						this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever
						reputation among all men for my life and for my
						art ; but if I transgress it and forswear myself, may
						the opposite befall me.</p>
