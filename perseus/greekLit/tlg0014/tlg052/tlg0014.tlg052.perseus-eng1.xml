                    situation harder to deal with, men of the jury, than when a man possessing both
                    reputation and ability to speak is audacious enough to lie and is well provided
                    with witnesses. For it becomes necessary for the defendant, no longer to speak
                    merely about the facts of the case, but about the character of the speaker as
                    well, and to show that he ought not to be believed on account of his reputation.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>If you are to establish the custom, that
                    those who are able speakers and who enjoy a reputation are more to be believed
                    than men of less ability, it will be against yourselves that you will have
                    established this custom. I beg you therefore, if you ever decided any other case
                    upon its merits, without becoming partisans of either side, whether the
                    plaintiff's or the defendant's, but looking to justice alone, to decide the
                    present case upon these principles. And I shall set forth the facts to you from
                    the beginning. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"

                    my father in the presence of Archebiades and Phrasias, and ordered my father to
                    pay the money which he left &lpar;it was sixteen minae forty drachmae, as I
                    shall show you very clearly&rpar; to Cephisiades, saying that this
                    Cephisiades was a partner of his, a resident of Scyros,<note resp="Loeb"

                    Archebiades and Phrasias to point him out and introduce him to my father, when
                    he should return from his journey. It is the custom of all bankers, when a
                    private person deposits money and directs that it be paid to a given person, to
                    write down first the name of the person making the deposit and the amount
                    deposited, and then to write on the margin &ldquo;to be paid to
                    so-and-so&rdquo;; and if they know the face of the person to whom payment is
                    to be made, they do merely this, write down whom they are to pay; but, if they
                    do not know it, it is their custom to write on the margin the name also of him
                    who is to introduce and point out the person who is to receive the money. For a
                    grievous misfortune befell this Lycon. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>No
                    sooner had he set out, and was sailing around the Argolic gulf, than his ship
                    was captured by pirate vessels and his goods taken to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, while he himself was shot down by an
                    arrow, and met his death. Immediately after this mischance this man Callippus
                    came to the bank, and asked whether they knew Lycon, the Heracleote. Phormion,
                    who is here present, answered that they knew him. &ldquo;Was he a customer
                    of yours?&rdquo; &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; said Phormion, &ldquo;but
                    why do you ask?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will
                    tell you. He is dead, and, as it happens, I am proxenos<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">The proxenos was sort of consular agent, empowered to act in

                    the Heracleotes. I demand therefore that you show me your books, that I may know
                    whether he has left any money; for I must of necessity look after the affairs of
                    all the men of <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>.&rdquo;
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>On hearing this, men of the jury, Phormion
                    immediately showed him the books, and, when he had done so, and Callippus
                    &lpar;it was he himself, and not another&rpar; had read them, and had
                    seen in them the entry, &ldquo;Lycon, the Heracleote, sixteen hundred and
                    forty drachmae, to be paid to Cephisiades; Archebiades of Lamptrae will identify
                    Cephisiades,&rdquo; he went off in silence and for more than five months
                    made no mention of the matter. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>After this
                    Cephisiades, having returned to <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                        >Athens</placeName>, came to the bank and demanded the money, and in the
                    presence of Archebiades and Phrasias, men of the jury, the persons whom Lycon
                    had introduced to my father, and had hidden to identify Cephisiades, when he
                    should return and in the presence of other witnesses also, Phormion, who is here
                    in court, counted out and paid him the sixteen minae forty drachmae.<milestone

                    However, a long time after this, the plaintiff Callippus came up to my father in
                    the city, and asked him if Cephisiades, to whom according to the entry in the
                    book the money left by Lycon the Heracleote was to be paid, had returned to
                        <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. On my father's replying
                    that he thought so, but, if he wanted to go down to the Peiraeus, he would find
                    out the truth, Callippus said to him, &ldquo;Do you know, Pasion, what it is
                    that I am asking you?&rdquo;&mdash; <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                    />&lpar;and by Zeus and Apollo and Demeter, I shall make no false statement
                    to you, men of the jury, but shall relate to you what I heard from my
                    father&rpar;&mdash;&ldquo;You have a chance,&rdquo; he
                    continued, &ldquo;to do a good turn to me, and no harm to yourself. It
                    happens that I am proxenos of the Heracleotes, and you would be glad, I should
                    think, to have me get the money rather than an alien who resides in Scyros, and
                    is a man of no account. Matters have turned out like this. Lycon was without
                    children, and has left, as I am informed, no heir in his house. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/>More than this, when he was brought to <placeName
                        key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, wounded, he gave to Strammenus, the
                        <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> proxenos of the Heracleotes,
                    the property which was brought in with him. I, therefore, am likewise in a
                    position to claim the money that is here; for I think it is right that I should
                    have it. Do you, therefore, if Cephisiades has not recovered it, say, if he
                    should come here, that I dispute his claim; and if he has recovered it, say that
                    I came with witnesses and demanded that the money be produced, or the person who
                    has received it; and, if anyone tries to defraud me, let him know that he is
                    defrauding a proxenos.&rdquo; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>After he had
                    spoken thus, my father answered, &ldquo;Callippus, I want to oblige you
                    &lpar;I should be mad, if I did not&rpar;, but on this condition, that I
                    shall not damage my own reputation, nor suffer any loss through the business; to
                    suggest what you propose to Archebiades and Aristono&uuml;s and to
                    Cephisiades himself, can cause me no trouble; but if they do not choose to do as
                    you say at my suggestion, you must talk to them yourself.&rdquo;
                    &ldquo;Be easy in your mind, Pasion,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;if you
                    like, you will force them to do what I want.&rdquo; <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This, men of the jury, is
                    what the plaintiff said to my father, and what my father repeated to Archebiades
                    and Cephisiades at the plaintiff's request and as a favor to him; and from this,
                    little by little, this suit has been got up. I was ready to swear by the most
                    solemn of oaths, that I verily heard these statements from my father. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/>The plaintiff, however, who demands that you believe
                    him as one speaking the truth, waited for three years after my father had spoken
                    for the first time to Archebiades and the other friends of Cephisiades, and
                    after they had refused to pay any attention to Callippus or to what he said;
                    then, when he learned that my father was in poor health, and had difficulty in
                    coming up to the city, and that his sight was failing, <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/>he brought an action against him, not indeed an action for
                    money, like the present one, but an action for damages, declaring that my father
                    had wrought him injury by paying to Cephisiades the money which Lycon, the
                    Heracleote, had left in his keeping after having promised not to pay it without
                    the plaintiff's consent. After he had brought suit, he took back the papers from
                    the public arbitrator, and challenged my father to refer the case to
                    Lysitheides, a friend of Callippus himself and of Isocrates and Aphareus,<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">These were doubtless the famous orator and the
                        tragic poet.</note> and an acquaintance of my father. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/>My father gave his consent, and during his lifetime
                    Lysitheides despite his intimacy with these men did not venture to commit any
                    wrong against us. And yet some of the plaintiff's friends are so lacking in
                    shame, that they had the audacity to depose that Callippus challenged my father
                    to take an oath, and that my father refused to swear before Lysitheides; and
                    they imagine that they can convince you that in that case Lysitheides, a friend
                    of Callippus and the one acting as arbitrator in the case, would have refrained
                    from making an immediate award against my father, especially since my father
                    thus refused to make himself the judge of his own case.<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="yes">By refusing, that is, to take the oath on the basis of which
                        the award would have been made.</note>
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That I am
                    telling the truth and that these men are lying, is proved, I claim, by the very
                    fact that Lysitheides would have made the award against my father, and that I
                    should now be defendant in an ejectment suit, and not in an action for money;
                    and, besides this, I shall bring before you as witnesses the persons who were
                    present on the various occasions when I met the plaintiff before

                    against me, you can easily see from the circumstantial evidence and from the
                    deposition. And that I was ready on my father's behalf to take the oath which
                    the law prescribes when an heir is sued in court on a charge brought against one
                    who is dead,&mdash; <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>that, namely, I

                    Phormion was ready to swear that in very truth he had himself reckoned up the
                    amount with Lycon in the presence of Archebiades, and that instructions were
                    given him to pay the money to Cephisiades, and that Archebiades had identified
                    Cephisiades for him; <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>also that when Callippus

                    had left any money, he, Phormion, had at once shown him the books, and that
                    Callippus, after seeing the entry that payment was to be made to Cephisiades,
                    went away in silence, without filing any counterclaim or making any protest to
                    him about the payment of the money&mdash;in proof of all these matters the

                    asserts that this money was given to him by Lycon as a present. Lycon had lent

                    brother Thrasyllus the sum of forty minae for a voyage to Ac&ecirc;<note

                    their minds and decided not to risk the voyage to that point, Lycon, after
                    making some complaints against Megacleides regarding the interest, and believing
                    that he had been deceived, quarrelled with him and went to law for the purpose
                    of recovering his loan. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>The proceedings were
                    prolonged, as so large a sum was at stake, yet Lycon never at any time called in
                    Callippus for consultation; he sought the aid of Archebiades and the friends of
                    Archebiades, and it was Archebiades who brought about a settlement between
                        them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To prove that I am speaking the truth, I
                    shall bring before you Megacleides himself as a witness to these facts.<quote

                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You see, men of
                    the jury, how intimate Lycon was with Callippus. He neither called him in for
                    consultation about his affairs, nor did he ever put up at the home of Callippus
                    as a guest; and this very fact is the one thing to which the plaintiff's friends
                    have not ventured to depose, that, namely, he ever did put up at his house; for
                    they knew well that, if they told any such lie as this, they would at once be
                    convicted by the slaves when these were put to the torture. <milestone n="23"
                        unit="section"/>But I wish to mention to you a piece of circumstantial
                    evidence so striking, that it will, I think, convince you that Callippus has
                    uttered nothing but a pack of lies. If Lycon, men of the jury, had been as fond
                    of the plaintiff and as intimate with him as the plaintiff claims, and had
                    wished to give him this money as a present in the event of anything happening to
                    himself, <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>would it not have been better to have
                    left the money outright in the custody of Callippus, in which case, if he
                    returned safe, he would have recovered it duly and justly from one who was his
                    friend and his proxenos, and, if anything had happened to him, he would have
                    given the money outright as he purposed? Would this, I ask, not have been better
                    than leaving it in the bank? For my part, I think the former course would have
                    been fairer and more highminded. However, he is seen to have done nothing of the
                    kind, so you must regard this as presumptive evidence; no; he gave written and
                    oral instructions that it was to Cephisiades that the money was to be paid.
                        <milestone n="25" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I would
                    have you regard the following point also, men of the jury. Callippus was one of
                    your citizens, a man able both to render a service and to do an injury, while
                    Cephisiades was a resident alien and a person without influence; so one cannot
                    suppose that my father would have taken the side of Cephisiades in defiance of
                    justice rather than do what was right for the plaintiff. <milestone n="26"
                        unit="section"/>Ah, but he will say perhaps, that my father got some private
                    profit out of the money, and therefore took sides with Cephisiades rather than
                    with the plaintiff. Then we are to believe, in the first place, that he wronged
                    a man who would be able to do him injury to twice the amount of his gains, and
                    secondly that my father in this instance was a base lover of gain, whereas in
                    regard to special taxes and public services and gifts to the state he was not.
                        <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>And did he, who never wronged a stranger,
                    wrong Callippus? And did the plaintiff, as he alleges, tender an oath to my
                    father as to one who was a worthy man and would tell no falsehood, and yet does
                    he now speak of him as a base fellow, who erases records of deposits? And, if my
                    father refused to take the oath, as the plaintiff claims, or to make payment,
                    how could he have escaped immediate condemnation? Who can believe this, men of
                    the jury? I certainly think no one can. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>And
                    has Archebiades forsooth sunk to such an extreme of baseness as to testify
                    against Callippus, a fellow-demesman of his own, one in public life, and an
                    official, and to say that I am telling the truth while Callippus is lying, and
                    all this, when he knows that, if Callippus chooses to proceed against him for
                    false testimony, or to do no more than put him on oath, he will be compelled to
                    take whatever oath Callippus may require? <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>And
                    again, can anyone persuade you that Archebiades would perjure himself in order
                    that Cephisiades, a resident alien, might get the money, or Phormion either, a
                    man whom Callippus charges with having expunged some records of deposit? It is
                    not a probable thing, men of the jury. Nor is it right to judge either
                    Archebiades or my father guilty of any act of baseness; you know that my father
                    was too emulous of honor to indulge in any base or shameful practices, and that
                    his relations with Callippus were not such as to lead him through contempt to do
                    him an injury. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>Callippus indeed does not
                    appear to me to be a man of such slight importance as to be treated with
                    contempt&mdash;a man of such influence that last year, after he had
                    instituted this action against me, and had challenged me to refer the matter to
                    Lysitheides for arbitration &lpar;and I, although scorned by him, yet took
                    wise counsel in this at any rate&mdash;I made the reference in due legal
                    form, and carried the matter before the magistrate&rpar;, Callippus, I say,
                    induced the arbitrator, who had been designated according to the laws, to
                    pronounce his award without taking oath, although I protested that he should
                    give it on oath as the laws ordain, his purpose being that he might be able to
                    say before you, that Lysitheides, a good and worthy man, had already given a
                    decision regarding the matters at issue. <milestone n="31" unit="section"
                    />Lysitheides, men of the jury, so long as my father lived, would probably not
                    have wronged him either with or without an oath, for he had a regard for him;
                    but for me he had no regard, while not upon his oath, although perhaps, if put
                    upon his oath, he would have abstained from wronging me in his own interest.
                    This is why he made the award without taking an oath.<milestone unit="para"
