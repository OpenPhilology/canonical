                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Inasmuch as the
                    laws, men of the jury, have granted that a special plea be entered in cases
                    where a man, after having given a release and discharge, nevertheless brings
                    suit, and as both of these have been given me by Pantaenetus here, I have
                    pleaded, as you have just now heard, that his suit is not admissible. I did not
                    think that I should forgo this right, or that, after I had proved among other
                    things that the plaintiff had released me, and that I had got rid of him, it
                    should be open to him to declare that I was uttering a falsehood and to try to
                    employ the argument that, if any such release had been granted me, I should have
                    put in a special plea to bar his suit. No, I determined to come before you
                    relying on this plea and to prove both points&mdash;that I have never done
                    the plaintiff any wrong, and that he is suing me contrary to law. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/>If Pantaenetus had suffered any of the wrongs with
                    which he now charges me, he would be found to have brought suit against me at
                    the time when the contract between us was made, for these actions must be
                    decided within the month,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, within a
                        month from the time of filing the suit; &ldquo;the object being that the
                        mine-proprieter might not be too long detained from his business.&rdquo;
                        &lpar;Boeckh, quoted by Sandys&rpar;.</note> and both Evergus and I
                    were in town; since all men are wont to be most indignant at the very time of
                    their wrongs, and not after a period has intervened. Since, however, the
                    plaintiff, though he has suffered no wrong, as I know well you will yourselves
                    agree when you have heard the facts, elated by the success of his suit against
                        Evergus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Evergus and Nicobulus, as stated in
                        the Introduction, had leased the mining property to Pantaenetus. As the
                        lessee failed to pay the interest, Evergus, in the absence of Nicobulus, who
                        had gone abroad, took possession of the property and even seized some silver
                        which a slave of Pantaenetus was bringing to his master that he might make a
                        payment due to the state. Because of this Pantaenetus became a debtor to the
                        state and was required to pay double the amount due. He then sued Evergus,
                        and won a verdict of two talents damages.</note> brings a malicious and
                    baseless action, there is no other course left me, men of the jury, than to
                    prove in your court that I am guilty of no wrong whatever, to produce witnesses
                    in support of what I say, and to endeavor to save myself. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/>I shall make a reasonable and fair request of you all, that
                    you hear with goodwill what I have to say regarding my special plea, and that
                    you give your attention to every aspect of the case. For, while hosts of cases
                    have been tried in Athens, I think it will be shown that no man has ever brought
                    before you one so marked by shamelessness and malice as this, which this fellow
                    has had the audacity to bring into your court. I shall with all possible brevity
                    set before you all the facts of the case. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Evergus and I, men of the jury, lent to
                    this man Pantaenetus one hundred and five minae on the security of a mining
                    property in Maroneia<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Maroneia was a small
                        district in the mining area of Laurium in Attica.</note> and of thirty
                    slaves. Of this loan forty-five minae belonged to me, and a talent to Evergus.
                    It happened that the plaintiff also owed a talent to Mnesicles of Collytus<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Collytus was a deme of the tribe
                        Aege&iuml;s.</note> and forty-five minae to Phileas of Eleusis and
                    Pleistor. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The vendor to us of the mining
                    property and the slaves was Mnesicles, for he had purchased them for the
                    plaintiff from Telemachus, the former owner; and the plaintiff leased them from
                    us at a rent equal to the interest accruing on the money, a hundred and five
                    drachmae a month. We drew up an agreement in which the terms of the lease were
                    stated, and the right was given the plaintiff of redeeming these things from us
                    within a given time. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>When these transactions
                    had been completed in the month of Elaphebolion in the archonship of
                        Theophilus,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, in March <date
                            value="-347">347</date> B.C.</note> I at once sailed away for Pontus,
                    but the plaintiff and Evergus remained here. What transactions they had with one
                    another while I was away, I cannot state, for they do not tell the same story,
                    nor is the plaintiff always consistent with himself; sometimes he says that he
                    was forcibly ousted from his leasehold by Evergus in violation of the agreement;
                    sometimes that Evergus was the cause of his being inscribed as a debtor to the
                        state;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See note on <bibl n="Dem. 37.2">Dem.
                            37.2</bibl> and the Introduction.</note> sometimes anything else that he
                    chooses to say. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>But Evergus tells a plain and
                    consistent story, that since he was not receiving his interest, and the
                    plaintiff was not performing any of the other things stipulated in the
                    agreement, he went and took from the plaintiff, with the latter's consent, what
                    was his own, and kept it; that after this the plaintiff went away, but came back
                    bringing men to make claim to the property; that he on his own part did not give
                    way in their favour, but made no objection to the plaintiff's holding that for
                    which he had given a lease, provided he should observe the terms of the
                    agreement. From these men, then, I hear stories of this sort. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/>This, however, I know well, that, if the plaintiff speaks
                    the truth, and has been outrageously treated, as he says, by Evergus, he has had
                    satisfaction to the amount at which he himself assessed his damages; for he came
                    into your court and won his suit against him; and surely he has no right to
                    obtain damages for the same wrongs both from the one who committed them and from
                    me, who was not even in Athens. But, if it is Evergus who speaks the truth, he
                    has been made the object, it appears, of a baseless and malicious charge; but
                    even so there is no ground for my being sued on the same charge.<milestone
                        ed="P" unit="para"/>To prove, in the first place, that I am speaking the
                    truth in this, I shall bring before you the witnesses to establish these
                        facts.<quote type="Witnesses">

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That, therefore,
                    the man who sold us the property was the man who had been the original
                    purchaser; that under the agreement the plaintiff rented the mining
                    establishment and the slaves, recognizing them as belonging to us; that I was
                    not present at the transactions which subsequently took place between the
                    plaintiff and Evergus, and indeed was not even in Athens; that he brought suit
                    against Evergus, and never made any charge against me,&mdash;all this, men
                    of the jury, you hear from the witnesses. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                    />Well, then, when I came back, having lost practically everything I had when I
                    sailed, I heard, and found it was true, that the plaintiff had given up the
                    property and that Evergus was in possession and control of what we had
                    purchased. I was distressed beyond words, seeing that the matter had got into an
                    awkward predicament; for it was now necessary for me either to enter into
                    partnership with Evergus for the working and management of the property, or have
                    him for a debtor instead of Pantaenetus, and draw up a new lease and enter into
                    a contract with him; and I liked neither of these alternatives. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/>Being vexed at the matters of which I am telling you,
                    and happening to see Mnesicles, who had sold us the property, I came up to him,
                    and reproached him, telling what sort of a man he had recommended to me, and I
                    questioned him regarding the claimants, asking what this was all about. On
                    hearing this, he laughed at the claimants, but stated that they wished to have a
                    conference with us. He declared that he would bring us together, and that he
                    would urge the plaintiff to do all that was right in my regard, and he thought
                    he would persuade him to do so. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>When we had
                    our meeting&mdash;what need is there to tell you all the
                    details?&mdash;the men came who claimed to have made loans to the plaintiff
                    on the security of the mining property and the slaves, which we bought from
                    Mnesicles; and there was nothing straightforward or honest about them. Then,
                    when they were convicted of falsehood in all their statements and Mnesicles
                    confirmed our having bought the property, they offered us a challenge, assuming
                    that we should not accept it, either to take all our money from them and
                    withdraw, or to settle with them by paying their claims; for the security which
                    we held was, they claimed, worth far more than the sums we had lent. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/>When I heard this, on the spur of the moment and
                    without even taking thought, I agreed to take my money, and I persuaded Evergus
                    to adopt the same course. But when the time came for us to receive our money,
                    the matter having been brought to this conclusion, the people who had previously
                    made the offer declared then that they would not pay us unless we became vendors
                    to them of the property, and in this point anyway, men of Athens, they were
                    prudent; for they saw in what baseless and malicious charges we were involved by
                    this fellow.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To prove that I am speaking the truth
                    in this, take, please, these depositions also.<quote type="Depositions">

                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When the matter
                    stood thus, and the people whom the plaintiff had introduced to us would not
                    give up the money, and it was clear that we were rightfully in possession of
                    what we had purchased, he begged, and implored, and besought us to sell the
                    property. As he made this demand and begged me most earnestly&mdash;there is
                    nothing he did not do&mdash;I gave way in this matter also. <milestone
                        n="15" unit="section"/>I saw, however, men of Athens, that he was a man of
                    evil disposition, that at the outset he had made charges to us against
                    Mnesicles, and then had quarrelled with Evergus, with whom he was on terms of
                    closest friendship; that at the first, when I returned from my voyage, he
                    pretended that he was glad to see me, but when the time came for him to do what
                    was right, he became surly with me; that he was a friend to all men until he got
                    some advantage and attained what he wanted, and thereafter became their foe and
                    was at variance with them; <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>I therefore thought
                    it best, if I withdrew and assumed the position of vendor in this man's
                    interest, that I should obtain a full release and discharge from all claims, and
                    thus make a final settlement with him. This was agreed to, and he gave me a
                    release in full, while I, as he begged me to do, assumed the position of vendor
                    of the property, exactly as I had myself bought it from Mnesicles. Having, then,
                    recovered my money, and having done the plaintiff no wrong whatsoever, I
                    imagined, by the gods, that, no matter what should happen, he would never bring
                    a suit against me. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"

                    these witnesses to prove that I have been released and am now the object of a
                    baseless and malicious charge, but Pantaenetus himself is a witness also. For
                    when, in bringing suit against Evergus, he left me out of the question, he
                    himself bore witness that he had no further claim against me. For surely,
                    assuming that he had the same charge to bring against both for the same
                    wrongdoing, he would not, when both were at hand, have passed over the one and
                    brought suit against the other. However, that the laws do not allow a fresh suit
                    to be brought regarding matters that have been thus settled you know, I presume,
                    even without my telling you.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nevertheless, read

                    have been effected between the plaintiff and myself, you have heard from the

                    sales made by the state, one might claim that it had made the sale unjustly, or
                    had sold what was not its own; <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>and in regard
                    to court decisions it might be claimed that the decision had been rendered
                    through error; and in all other cases where the law forbids action exception
                    might plausibly be taken to each one. But when anyone has himself yielded to
                    argument and given a release, he cannot in the very nature of the case charge
                    himself with having acted unjustly. Those who bring suit in defiance of any
                    other of these provisions fail to abide by what others have determined to be
                    just; but he who again brings suit in matters regarding which he has given a
                    release fails to abide by his own decision. Therefore, against all such your

                    of the jury, with all frankness. I am perfectly aware&mdash;I am not blind

                    single one among you, many as you are, know any such thing against me. As to
                    these other qualities, each one of us, I take it, is as nature happened to make

                    wronged in any way by me. Otherwise you would never have given me the release,
                    nor, when you were making up your mind to bring suit against Evergus, would you
                    have passed me by; nor would you have demanded that one who had done you many
                    grievous wrongs should undertake to be vendor of the property. Besides, how
                    could I have wronged you, when I was not present or even in the country?

                    that Pantaenetus has suffered the greatest possible wrongs, and that everything
                    which he will now allege about these matters is true, this, at least, I presume,
                    you would all admit: that it has happened to others ere now to have suffered

                    death releases the murderer from bloodguiltiness, it is not lawful for any of
                    the remaining kinsmen to prosecute; but those whom the laws sentence to
                    banishment and exile and death, upon conviction, if they are once released, are

                    this power and validity, shall it be without effect when money is at stake, or
                    claims of lesser importance? Surely not. For the thing most to be feared is, not
                    that I should fail to obtain justice in your court, but that you should now in
                    our day do away with a just practice, established from the beginning of
