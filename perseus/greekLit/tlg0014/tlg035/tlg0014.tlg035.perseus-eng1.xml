                    new tricks; they are merely doing what it is their wont to do. For they are the
                    cleverest people at borrowing money on your exchange; but, as soon as they get
                    it and have drawn up a maritime contract, they straightway forget the contract
                    and the laws, and that they are under obligation to pay back what they have
                    received. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They consider that, if they pay their
                    debts, it is like having lost something of their own private property, and,
                    instead of paying, they invent sophisms, and special pleas, and pretexts; and
                    are the most unprincipled and dishonest of men. Here is a proof of this. Out of
                    the hosts of people, both Greeks and barbarians, who frequent your exchange, the
                    Phaselites alone have more lawsuits, whenever the courts sit,<note resp="Loeb"

                    before having repaid me the money I have brought this suit against Lacritus here
                    in accordance with the same laws under which I made the contract, <milestone

                    him the right to hold his brother's property and to have administered it as he
                    pleased, and yet to refuse to pay back money which belongs to others and to say
                    now that he is not the. heir, but has nothing to do with the dead man's affairs.

                    Lacritus; but I beg of you, men of the jury, to give me a favorable hearing in
                    regard to this matter and, if I prove to you that he has wronged us, who lent

                    brother, are friends of mine, and we are on the most intimate terms possible.
                    These men came up to me with Lacritus here, whose acquaintance they had made in

                    trading enterprise. Thrasymedes like myself knew nothing of the rascality of
                    these people, but supposed them to be honorable men and such as they pretended
                    and declared themselves to be; and that they would do all that they promised and
                    that this fellow Lacritus undertook that they should do. <milestone n="8"

                    men were with whom he was associating. I allowed myself to be persuaded by

                    that his brothers would do everything that was right, I, with the help of a

                    instructed his own brothers in this art, which you, men of the jury, see to be

                    maritime adventure, and then defrauding the lenders, and refusing to pay them.
                    How could there be men baser than the one who teaches such an art, or than those
                    who learn of him? Since, then, he is so clever, and trusts in his power of
                    speaking and in the one thousand drachmae which he has paid to his teacher,
                        <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>bid him show you, either that they did not
                    borrow the money from us, or that, having borrowed it, they have paid it back;
                    or that agreements for overseas trade ought not to be binding; or that it is
                    right for people to use money for some other purpose than that for which they
                    received it under agreement. Let him prove to you whatever one of these
                    propositions he chooses. If he can so prove it to you who sit to decide cases of
                    mercantile contracts, I certainly concede that he is the cleverest of men. But I

                    do you fancy that this fellow, Lacritus, would employ the same language that he
                    now so lavishly uses? Or would say that he is not the heir and has nothing to do
                    with his brother's affairs? Or that he would not exact payment from me
                    mercilessly, as he has from the others who owed anything to the deceased,

                    court, I know well that he would have waxed indignant, and would have protested
                    to you, declaring that he was suffering treatment that was outrageous and
                    contrary to law, if anyone voted that his action, being a mercantile one, was
                    not one that could be brought. Then, Lacritus, if you consider this just for
                    yourself, why should it not be just for me? Do not the same laws stand written
                    for us all? And have we not all the same rights in regard to mercantile suits?

                    prison by those who borrowed and are seeking to evade payment? Is it this,

                    where are we to obtain justice in the matter of commercial contracts? Before
