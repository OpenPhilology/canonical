The Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera. There is a certain <placeName key="perseus,Nysa">Nysa</placeName>, a mountain most high and richly grown with woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName><gap/></p>
<p><milestone ed="P" n="10" unit="line"/>“and men will lay up for her<note anchored="true" resp="ed"><hi rend="ital">sc.</hi> Semele. Zeus is here speaking.</note> many offerings in her shrines. And as these things are three,<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The reference is apparently to something in the body of the hymn, now lost.</note> so shall mortals ever sacrifice perfect hecatombs to you at your feasts each three years.”</p>
<p>The Son of Cronos spoke and nodded with his dark brows. And the divine locks of the king flowed forward <milestone ed="P" n="15" unit="line"/>from his immortal head, and he made great <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> reel. So spake wise Zeus and ordained it with a nod.</p>
<p>Be favorable, O Insewn, Inspirer of frenzied women! we singers sing of you as we begin and as we end a strain, and none forgetting you may call holy song to mind. <milestone ed="P" n="20" unit="line"/>And so, farewell, Dionysus, Insewn, with your mother Semele whom men call Thyone.</p>
