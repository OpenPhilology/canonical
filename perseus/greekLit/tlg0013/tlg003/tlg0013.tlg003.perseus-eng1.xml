        <p><milestone ed="P" n="1" unit="line"/>I will remember and not be unmindful of Apollo who
          shoots afar. As he goes through the house of Zeus, the gods tremble before him and all
          spring up from their seats when he draws near, as he bends his bright bow. <milestone
            ed="P" n="5" unit="line"/>But Leto alone stays by the side of Zeus who delights in
          thunder; and then she unstrings his bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from
          his strong shoulders in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg against a pillar of his
          father's house. Then she leads him to a seat and makes him sit: <milestone ed="P" n="10"
            unit="line"/>and the Father gives him nectar in a golden cup welcoming his dear son,
          while the other gods make him sit down there, and queenly Leto rejoices because she bare a
          mighty son and an archer. Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children,
            <milestone ed="P" n="15" unit="line"/>the lord Apollo and Artemis who delights in

        <p>How, then, shall I sing of you who in all ways are a worthy theme of song? <milestone

          to you, both over the mainland that rears heifers and over the isles. All mountain-peaks
          and high headlands of lofty hills and rivers flowing out to the deep and beaches sloping
          seawards and havens of the sea are your delight. <milestone ed="P" n="25" unit="line"
          />Shall I sing how at the first Leto bare you to be the joy of men, as she rested against
          Mount Cynthus in that rocky isle, in sea-girt <placeName key="perseus,Delos"
            >Delos</placeName> —while on either hand a dark wave rolled on landwards driven by

          — <milestone ed="P" n="45" unit="line"/>so far roamed Leto in travail with the god who
          shoots afar, to see if any land would be willing to make a dwelling for her son.
            <milestone ed="P" n="47" unit="card"/>But they greatly trembled and feared, and none,
          not even the richest of them, dared receive Phoebus, <milestone ed="P" n="50" unit="line"
          />until queenly Leto set foot on <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> and
          uttered winged words and asked her:</p>
        <p>“<placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, if you would be willing to be the
          abode of my son Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich temple —; for no other will touch you,
          as you will find: and I think you will never be rich in oxen and sheep, <milestone ed="P"
            n="55" unit="line"/>nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants abundantly. But if you have
          the temple of far-shooting Apollo, all men will bring you hecatombs and gather here, and
          incessant savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will feed those who dwell in
          you <milestone ed="P" n="60" unit="line"/>from the hand of strangers; for truly your own
          soil is not rich.”</p>
        <p>So spake Leto. And <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> rejoiced and answered
          and said: “Leto, most glorious daughter of great Coeus, joyfully would I receive your
          child the far-shooting lord; for it is all too true that I am ill-spoken of <milestone
            ed="P" n="65" unit="line"/>among men, whereas thus I should become very greatly honored.
          But this saying I fear, and I will not hide it from you, Leto. They say that Apollo will
          be one that is very haughty and will greatly lord it among gods and men all over the
          fruitful earth. <milestone ed="P" n="70" unit="line"/>Therefore, I greatly fear in heart
          and spirit that as soon as he sees the light of the sun, he will scorn this island —for
          truly I have but a hard, rocky soil —and overturn me and thrust me down with his feet in
          the depths of the sea; then will the great ocean wash deep above my head for ever,
            <milestone ed="P" n="75" unit="line"/>and he will go to another land such as will please
          him, there to make his temple and wooded groves. So many-footed creatures of the sea will
          make their lairs in me and black seals their dwellings undisturbed, because I lack people.
          Yet if you will but dare to swear a great oath, goddess, <milestone ed="P" n="80"
            unit="line"/>that here first he will build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men,
          then let him afterwards <milestone ed="P" n="81a" unit="line"/>make temples and wooded
          groves amongst all men; for surely he will be greatly renowned.</p>
        <p>So said <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. And Leto swear the great oath
          of the gods: “Now hear this, Earth and wide Heaven above, <milestone ed="P" n="85"
            unit="line"/>and dropping water of Styx (this is the strongest and most awful oath for
          the blessed gods), surely Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar and precinct, and you
          he shall honor above all.”<milestone ed="P" n="89" unit="card"/></p>
        <p>Now when Leto had sworn and ended her oath, <milestone ed="P" n="90" unit="line"
            /><placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> was very glad at the birth of the
          far-shooting lord. But Leto was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont.
            <milestone ed="P" n="95" unit="line"/>And there were with her all the chiefest of the
          goddesses, Dione and Rhea and Ichnaea and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the other
          deathless goddesses save white-armed Hera, who sat in the halls of cloud-gathering Zeus.
          Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on
          the top of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> beneath golden clouds by
          white-armed Hera's <milestone ed="P" n="100" unit="line"/>contriving, who kept her close
          through envy, because Leto with the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and
          strong.</p>
        <p>But the goddesses sent out Iris from the well-set isle to bring Eilithyia, promising her
          a great necklace strung with golden threads, nine cubits long. <milestone ed="P" n="105"
            unit="line"/>And they bade Iris call her aside from white-armed Hera, lest she might
          afterwards turn her from coming with her words. When swift Iris, fleet of foot as the
          wind, had heard all this, she set to run; and quickly finishing all the distance she came
          to the home of the gods, sheer <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>,
            <milestone ed="P" n="110" unit="line"/>and forthwith called Eilithyia out from the hall
          to the door and spoke winged words to her, telling her all as the goddesses who dwell on
            <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> had bidden her. So she moved the heart
          of Eilithyia in her dear breast; and they went their way, like shy wild-doves in their
          going.</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="115" unit="line"/>And as soon as Eilithyia the goddess of sore
          travail set foot on <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, the pains of birth
          seized Leto, and she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree and
          kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy beneath. Then the child leaped
          forth to the light, and all the goddesses raised a cry. <milestone ed="P" n="120"
            unit="line"/>Straightway, great Phoebus, the goddesses washed you purely and cleanly
          with sweet water, and swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and
          fastened a golden band about you.</p>
        <p>Now Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, her breast; but Themis duly
          poured nectar and ambrosia <milestone ed="P" n="125" unit="line"/>with her divine hands:
          and Leto was glad because she had borne a strong son and an archer. But as soon as you had
          tasted that divine heavenly food, O Phoebus, you could no longer then be held by golden
          cords nor confined with bands, but all their ends were undone. <milestone ed="P" n="130"
            unit="line"/>Forth-with Phoebus Apollo spoke out among the deathless
            goddesses:<milestone ed="P" n="131" unit="card"/></p>
        <p>“The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to me, and I will declare to men the
          unfailing will of Zeus.”</p>
        <p>So said Phoebus, the long-haired god who shoots afar and began to walk upon the
          wide-pathed earth; <milestone ed="P" n="135" unit="line"/>and all the goddesses were
          amazed at him. Then with gold all <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> [was
          laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto, for joy because the god chose her above the
          islands and shore to make his dwelling in her: and she loved him yet more in her heart.]
          blossomed as does a mountain-top with woodland flowers.</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="140" unit="line"/>And you, O lord Apollo, god of the silver bow,
          shooting afar, now walked on craggy Cynthus, and now kept wandering about the islands and
          the people in them. Many are your temples and wooded groves, and all peaks and towering
          bluffs <milestone ed="P" n="145" unit="line"/>of lofty mountains and rivers flowing to the
          sea are dear to you, Phoebus, yet in <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> do
          you most delight your heart; for there the long robed Ionians gather in your honor with
          their children and shy wives: with boxing and dancing and song, <milestone ed="P" n="150"
            unit="line"/>mindful, they delight you so often as they hold their gathering. A man
          would say that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon the Ionians so
          met together. For he would see the graces of them all, and would be pleased in heart
          gazing at the men and well-girded women <milestone ed="P" n="155" unit="line"/>with their
          swift ships and great wealth. And there is this great wonder besides —and its renown shall
          never perish —, the girls of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>,
          hand-maidens of the Far-shooter; for when they have praised Apollo first, and also Leto
          and Artemis who delights in arrows, <milestone ed="P" n="160" unit="line"/>they sing a
          strain telling of men and women of past days, and charm the tribes of men. Also they can
          imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering speech: each would say that he himself
          were singing, so close to truth is their sweet song.</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="165" unit="line"/>And now may Apollo be favorable and Artemis; and
          farewell all you maidens. Remember me in after time whenever any one of men on earth, a
          stranger who has seen and suffered much, comes here and asks of you: “Whom think ye,
          girls, is the sweetest singer that comes here, and in whom do you most delight?”
            <milestone ed="P" n="170" unit="line"/>Then answer, each and all, with one voice: “He is
          a blind man, and dwells in rocky <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>: his lays
          are evermore supreme.” As for me, I will carry your renown as far as I roam over the earth
            <milestone ed="P" n="175" unit="line"/>to the well-placed cities of man, and they will
          believe also; for indeed this thing is true. And I will never cease to praise far-shooting
          Apollo, god of the silver bow, whom rich-haired Leto bare.</p>

            ed="P" n="185" unit="line"/>at the touch of the golden key, sings sweet. Thence, swift
          as thought, he speeds from earth to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, to
          the house of Zeus, to join the gathering of the other gods: then straightway the undying
          gods think only of the lyre and song, and all the Muses together, voice sweetly answering
          voice, <milestone ed="P" n="190" unit="line"/>hymn the unending gifts the gods enjoy and
          the sufferings of men, all that they endure at the hands of the deathless gods, and how
          they live witless and helpless and cannot find healing for death or defence against old
          age. Meanwhile the rich-tressed Graces and cheerful Seasons dance with <milestone ed="P"
            n="195" unit="line"/>Harmonia and Hebe and Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, holding each
          other by the wrist. And among them sings one, not mean nor puny, but tall to look upon and
          enviable in mien, Artemis who delights in arrows, sister of Apollo. <milestone ed="P"
            n="200" unit="line"/>Among them sport Ares and the keen-eyed Slayer of Argus, while
          Apollo plays his lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around him, the
          gleaming of his feet and close-woven vest. And they, <milestone ed="P" n="205" unit="line"
          />even gold-tressed Leto and wise Zeus, rejoice in their great hearts as they watch their
          dear son playing among the undying gods.</p>
        <p>How then shall I sing of you —though in all ways you are a worthy theme for song? Shall I
          sing of you as wooer and in the fields of love, how you went wooing the daughter of Azan
            <milestone ed="P" n="210" unit="line"/>along with god-like Ischys the son of well-horsed
          Elatius, or with Phorbas sprung from Triops, or with Ereutheus, or with Leucippus and the
          wife of Leucippus<gap/>you on foot, he with his chariot, yet he fell not short of Triops.
          Or shall I sing how at the first <milestone ed="P" n="215" unit="line"/>you went about the
          earth seeking a place of oracle for men, O far-shooting Apollo? To Pieria first you went
          down from <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> and passed by sandy Lectus and
          Enienae and through the land of the Perrhaebi. Soon you came to Iolcus and set foot on
          Cenaeum in <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, famed for ships: <milestone
            ed="P" n="220" unit="line"/>you stood in the Lelantine plain, but it pleased not your
          heart to make a temple there and wooded groves. From there you crossed the Euripus,
          far-shooting Apollo, and went up the green, holy hills, going on to Mycalessus and
          grassy-bedded Teumessus,<milestone ed="P" n="225" unit="card"/><milestone ed="P" n="225"
            unit="line"/>and so came to the wood-clad abode of Thebe; for as yet no man lived in
          holy Thebe, nor were there tracks or ways about Thebe's wheat-bearing plain as yet.</p>
        <p>And further still you went, O far-shooting Apollo, <milestone ed="P" n="230" unit="line"
          />and came to Onchestus, Poseidon's bright grove: there the new-broken colt distressed
          with drawing the trim chariot gets spirit again, and the skilled driver springs from his
          car and goes on his way. Then the horses for a while rattle the empty car, being rid of
          guidance; <milestone ed="P" n="235" unit="line"/>and if they break the chariot in the
          woody grove, men look after the horses, but tilt the chariot and leave it there; for this
          was the rite from the very first. And the drivers pray to the lord of the shrine; but the
          chariot falls to the lot of the god.</p>
        <p>Further yet you went, O far-shooting Apollo, <milestone ed="P" n="240" unit="line"/>and
          reached next Cephissus' sweet stream which pours forth its sweet-flowing water from
          Lilaea, and crossing over it, O worker from afar, you passed many-towered Ocalea and
          reached grassy Haliartus.</p>
        <p>Then you went towards Telphusa: and there the pleasant place seemed fit for <milestone
            ed="P" n="245" unit="line"/>making a temple and wooded grove. You came very near and
          spoke to her: “Telphusa, here I am minded to make a glorious temple, an oracle for men,
          and hither they will always bring perfect hecatombs, <milestone ed="P" n="250" unit="line"
          />both those who live in rich <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and
          those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> and all the wave-washed isles,
          coming to seek oracles. And I will deliver to them all counsel that cannot fail, giving
          answer in my rich temple.”</p>
        <p>So said Phoebus Apollo, and laid out all the foundations <milestone ed="P" n="255"
            unit="line"/>throughout, wide and very long. But when Telphusa saw this, she was angry
          in heart and spoke, saying: “Lord Phoebus, worker from afar, I will speak a word of
          counsel to your heart, since you are minded to make here a glorious temple to be an oracle
          for men who will always <milestone ed="P" n="260" unit="line"/>bring hither perfect
          hecatombs for you; yet I will speak out, and do you lay up my words in your heart. The
          trampling of swift horses and the sound of mules watering at my sacred springs will always
          irk you, and men will like better to gaze at <milestone ed="P" n="265" unit="line"/>the
          well-made chariots and stamping, swift-footed horses than at your great temple and the
          many treasures that are within. <milestone ed="P" n="267" unit="card"/>But if you will be
          moved by me —for you, lord, are stronger and mightier than I, and your strength is very
          great —build at <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName> below the glades of
            <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>: <milestone ed="P" n="270"
            unit="line"/>there no bright chariot will clash, and there will be no noise of
          swift-footed horses near your well-built altar. But so the glorious tribes of men will
          bring gifts to you as Iepaeon (‘Hail-Healer’), and you will receive with delight rich
          sacrifices from the people dwelling round about.” <milestone ed="P" n="275" unit="line"
          />So said Telphusa, that she alone, and not the Far-Shooter, should have renown there; and
          she persuaded the Far-Shooter.</p>
        <p>Further yet you went, far-shooting Apollo, until you came to the town of the presumptuous
          Phlegyae who dwell on this earth <milestone ed="P" n="280" unit="line"/>in a lovely glade
          near the Cephisian lake, caring not for Zeus. And thence you went speeding swiftly to the
          mountain ridge, and came to <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName> beneath snowy
            <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, a foothill turned towards the west:
          a cliff hangs over it from above, and a hollow, rugged glade runs under. <milestone ed="P"
            n="285" unit="line"/>There the lord Phoebus Apollo resolved to make his lovely temple,
          and thus he said:</p>
        <p>“In this place I am minded to build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men, and here
          they will always bring perfect hecatombs, <milestone ed="P" n="290" unit="line"/>both they
          who dwell in rich <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and the men of
            <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> and from all the wave-washed isles,
          coming to question me. And I will deliver to them all counsel that cannot fail, answering
          them in my rich temple.”</p>
        <p>When he had said this, Phoebus Apollo laid out all the foundations <milestone ed="P"
            n="295" unit="line"/>throughout, wide and very long; and upon these the sons of Erginus,
          Trophonius and Agamedes, dear to the deathless gods, laid a footing of stone. And the
          countless tribes of men built the whole temple of wrought stones, to be sung of for
          ever.</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="300" unit="line"/>But near by was a sweet flowing spring, and there
          with his strong bow the lord, the son of Zeus, killed the bloated, great she-dragon, a
          fierce monster wont to do great mischief to men upon earth, to men themselves and to their
          thin-shanked sheep; for she was a very bloody plague.<milestone ed="P" n="305" unit="card"
            /><milestone ed="P" n="305" unit="line"/>She it was who once received from gold-throned
          Hera and brought up fell, cruel Typhaon to be a plague to men. Once on a time Hera bare
          him because she was angry with father Zeus, when the Son of Cronos bare all-glorious
          Athena in his head. Thereupon queenly Hera was angry <milestone ed="P" n="310" unit="line"
          />and spoke thus among the assembled gods:</p>
        <p>“Hear from me, all gods and goddesses, how cloud-gathering Zeus begins to dishonor me
          wantonly, when he has made me his true-hearted wife. See now, apart from me he has given
          birth to bright-eyed Athena <milestone ed="P" n="315" unit="line"/>who is foremost among
          all the blessed gods. But my son Hephaestus whom I bare <milestone ed="P" n="317a"
            unit="line"/>was weakly among all the blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and a
          disgrace to me in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he fell in
          the great sea. But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of Nereus <milestone ed="P" n="320"
            unit="line"/>took and cared for him with her sisters: would that she had done other
          service to the blessed gods! O wicked one and crafty! What else will you now devise? How
          dared you by yourself give birth to bright-eyed Athena? Would not I have borne you a child
          —I, who was at least called your wife <milestone ed="P" n="325" unit="line"/>among the
          undying gods who hold wide heaven. <milestone ed="P" n="325a" unit="line"/>Beware now lest
          I devise some evil thing for you hereafter: yes, now I will contrive that a son be born me
          to be foremost among the undying gods —and that without casting shame on the holy bond of
          wedlock between you and me. <milestone ed="P" n="330" unit="line"/>And I will not come to
          your bed, but will consort with the blessed gods far off from you.”</p>
        <p>When she had so spoken, she went apart from the gods, being very angry. Then straightway
          large-eyed queenly Hera prayed, striking the ground flatwise with her hand, and speaking
          thus:</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="335" unit="line"/>“Hear now, I pray, Earth and wide Heaven above and
          you Titan gods who dwell beneath the earth about great Tartarus, and from whom are sprung
          both gods and men! Harken you now to me, one and all, and grant that I may bear a child
          apart from Zeus, no wit lesser than him in strength —nay, let him be as much stronger than
          Zeus as all-seeing Zeus than Cronos.” <milestone ed="P" n="340" unit="line"/>Thus she
          cried and lashed the earth with her strong hand. Then the life-giving earth was moved: and
          when Hera saw it she was glad in heart, for she thought her prayer would be fulfilled. And
          thereafter she never came to the bed of wise Zeus for a full year, <milestone ed="P"
            n="345" unit="line"/>nor to sit in her carved chair as aforetime to plan wise counsel
          for him, but stayed in her temples where many pray, and delighted in her offerings,
          large-eyed queenly Hera.<milestone ed="P" n="349" unit="card"/> But when the months and
          days were fulfilled <milestone ed="P" n="350" unit="line"/>and the seasons duly came on as
          the earth moved round, she bare one neither like the gods nor mortal men, fell, cruel
          Typhaon, to be a plague to men. Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing
          one evil thing to another such, gave him to the dragoness; and she received him.
            <milestone ed="P" n="355" unit="line"/>And this Typhaon used to work great mischief
          among the famous tribes of men. Whosoever met the dragoness, the day of doom would sweep
          him away, until the lord Apollo, who deals death from afar, shot a strong arrow at her.
          Then she, rent with bitter pangs, lay drawing great gasps for breath and rolling about
          that place. <milestone ed="P" n="360" unit="line"/>An awful noise swelled up unspeakable
          as she writhed continually this way and that amid the wood: and so she left her life,
          breathing it forth in blood. Then Phoebus Apollo boasted over her:</p>
        <p>“Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man' You at least shall live no more to be a fell
          bane to men <milestone ed="P" n="365" unit="line"/>who eat the fruit of the all-nourishing
          earth, and who will bring hither perfect hecatombs. Against cruel death neither Typhoeus
          shall avail you nor ill-famed Chimera, but here shall the Earth and shining Hyperion make
          you rot.”</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="370" unit="line"/>Thus said Phoebus, exulting over her: and darkness
          covered her eyes. And the holy strength of Helios made her rot away there; wherefore the
          place is now called <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, and men call the lord
          Apollo by another name, Pythian; because on that spot the power of piercing Helios made
          the monster rot away.</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="375" unit="line"/>Then Phoebus Apollo saw that the sweet-flowing
          spring had beguiled him, and he started out in anger against Telphusa; and soon coming to
          her, he stood close by and spoke to her:</p>
        <p>“Telphusa, you were not, after all, to keep to yourself this lovely place by deceiving my
          mind, <milestone ed="P" n="380" unit="line"/>and pour forth your clear flowing water: here
          my renown shall also be and not yours alone?”</p>
        <p>Thus spoke the lord, far-working Apollo, and pushed over upon her a crag with a shower of
          rocks, hiding her streams: and he made himself an altar in a wooded grove <milestone
            ed="P" n="385" unit="line"/>very near the clear-flowing stream. In that place all men
          pray to the great one by the name Telphusian, because he humbled the stream of holy
          Telphusa.</p>
        <p>Then Phoebus Apollo pondered in his heart what men he should bring in <milestone ed="P"
            n="390" unit="line"/>to be his ministers in sacrifice and to serve him in rocky
            <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>. And while he considered this, he became
          aware of a swift ship upon the wine-like sea in which were many men and goodly, Cretans
          from <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossos</placeName>,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"

            key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>.<milestone ed="P" n="397" unit="card"/> These
          men were sailing in their black ship for traffic and for profit to sandy <placeName

            >Pylos</placeName>. But Phoebus Apollo met them: <milestone ed="P" n="400" unit="line"
          />in the open sea he sprang upon their swift ship, like a dolphin in shape, and lay there,
          a great and awesome monster, and none of them gave heed so as to understand<note
            anchored="true" resp="ed"><hi rend="ital">sc.</hi> that the dolphin was really
            Apollo.</note>; <milestone ed="P" n="402a" unit="line"/>but they sought to cast the
          dolphin overboard. But he kept shaking the black ship every way and making the timbers
          quiver. So they sat silent in their craft for fear, <milestone ed="P" n="405" unit="line"
          />and did not loose the sheets throughout the black, hollow ship, nor lowered the sail of
          their dark-prowed vessel, but as they had set it first of all with oxhide ropes, so they
          kept sailing on; for a rushing south wind hurried on the swift ship from behind. First
          they passed by Malea, <milestone ed="P" n="410" unit="line"/>and then along the Laconian
          coast they came to Taenarum, sea-garlanded town and country of Helios who gladdens men,
          where the thick-fleeced sheep of the lord Helios feed continually and occupy a gladsome
          country. There they wished to put their ship to shore, and land <milestone ed="P" n="415"
            unit="line"/>and comprehend the great marvel and see with their eyes whether the monster
          would remain upon the deck of the hollow ship, or spring back into the briny deep where
          fishes shoal. But the well-built ship would not obey the helm, but went on its way all
          along <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>: <milestone ed="P" n="420"
            unit="line"/>and the lord, far-working Apollo, guided it easily with the breath of the
          breeze. So the ship ran on its course and came to Arena and lovely Argyphea and Thryon,
          the ford of Alpheus, and well-placed Aepy and sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos"
            >Pylos</placeName> and the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>;
            <milestone ed="P" n="425" unit="line"/>past Cruni it went and <placeName

          Zeus, there appeared to them below the clouds the steep mountain of <placeName
            key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and Dulichium and Same and wooded <placeName
            key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>. <milestone ed="P" n="430" unit="line"/>But when
          they were passed by all the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7017076"
          >Peloponnesus</placeName>, then, towards <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName>,
          that vast gulf began to heave in sight which through all its length cuts off the rich isle
          of Pelops. There came on them a strong, clear west-wind by ordinance of Zeus and blew from
          heaven vehemently, that with all speed <milestone ed="P" n="435" unit="line"/>the ship
          might finish coursing over the briny water of the sea. So they began again to voyage back
          towards the dawn and the sun: and the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, led them on until they
          reached far-seen <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName>, land of vines, and into
          haven: there the sea-coursing ship grounded on the sands.</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="440" unit="line"/>Then, like a star at noonday, the lord,
          far-working Apollo, leaped from the ship: flashes of fire flew from him thick and their
          brightness reached to heaven. He entered into his shrine between priceless tripods,
            <milestone ed="P" n="444" unit="card"/>and there made a flame to flare up bright,
          showing forth the splendor of his shafts, so that their radiance <milestone ed="P" n="445"

          and well-girded daughters of the Crisaeans raised a cry at that outburst of Phoebus; for
          he cast great fear upon them all. From his shrine he sprang forth again, swift as a
          thought, to speed again to the ship, bearing the form of a man, brisk and sturdy,
            <milestone ed="P" n="450" unit="line"/>in the prime of his youth, while his broad
          shoulders were covered with his hair: and he spoke to the Cretans, uttering winged
          words:</p>
        <p>“Strangers, who are you? Whence come you sailing along the paths of the sea? Are you for
          traffic, or do you wander at random over the sea as pirates do who put <milestone ed="P"
            n="455" unit="line"/>their own lives to hazard and bring mischief to men of foreign
          parts as they roam? Why rest you so and are afraid, and do not go ashore nor stow the gear
          of your black ship? For that is the custom of men who live by bread, whenever they come to
          land in their dark ships from the main, <milestone ed="P" n="460" unit="line"/>spent with
          toil: at once desire for sweet food catches them about the heart.”</p>
        <p>So speaking, he put courage in their hearts, and the master of the Cretans answered him
          and said: “Stranger —though you are nothing like mortal men <milestone ed="P" n="465"
            unit="line"/>in shape or stature, but are as the deathless gods —hail and all happiness
          to you, and may the gods give you good. Now tell me truly that I may surely know it: what
          country is this, and what land, and what men live herein? As for us, with thoughts set
          otherwards, we were sailing over the great sea <milestone ed="P" n="470" unit="line"/>to
            <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7012056"
            >Crete</placeName> (for from there we declare that we are sprung), but now are come on
          shipboard to this place by no means willingly —another way and other paths —and gladly
          would we return. But one of the deathless gods brought us here against our will.”</p>
        <p>Then far-working Apollo answered them and said: <milestone ed="P" n="475" unit="line"
          />“Strangers who once dwelt about wooded <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossos</placeName>
          but now shall return no more each to his loved city and fair house and dear wife; here
          shall you keep my rich temple that is honored by many men. <milestone ed="P" n="480"

          their will <milestone ed="P" n="485" unit="line"/>you shall be honored continually for all
          time. And now come, make haste and do as I say. First loose the sheets and lower the sail,
          and then draw the swift ship up upon the land. Take out your goods and the gear of the
          straight ship, <milestone ed="P" n="490" unit="line"/>and make an altar upon the beach of
          the sea: light fire upon it and make an offering of white meal. Next, stand side by side
          around the altar and pray:<milestone ed="P" n="493" unit="card"/> and in as much as at the

        <p>So said Apollo. And they readily harkened to him and obeyed him. First they unfastened
          the sheets and let down the sail and lowered the mast by the forestays upon the mast-rest.
            <milestone ed="P" n="505" unit="line"/>Then, landing upon the beach of the sea, they
          hauled up the ship from the water to dry land and fixed long stays under it. Also they
          made an altar upon the beach of the sea, and when they had lit a fire, made an offering of
          white meal, <milestone ed="P" n="510" unit="line"/>and prayed standing around the altar as
          Apollo had bidden them. Then they took their meal by the swift, black ship, and poured an
          offering to the blessed gods who dwell on <placeName key="tgn,7011019"
          >Olympus</placeName>. And when they had put away craving for drink and food, they started
          out with the lord Apollo, the son of Zeus, to lead them, <milestone ed="P" n="515"
            unit="line"/>holding a lyre in his hands, and playing sweetly as he stepped high and

          marching in time as they chanted the Ie Paean after the manner of the Cretan paean-singers
          and of those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse has put sweet-voiced song. <milestone

        <p>“Lord, since you have brought us here far from our dear ones and our fatherland, —for so
          it seemed good to your heart,—tell us now how we shall live. That we would know of you.
          This land is not to be desired either for vineyards or for pastures <milestone ed="P"
            n="530" unit="line"/>so that we can live well thereon and also minister to
            men.”<milestone ed="P" n="531" unit="card"/></p>
        <p>Then Apollo, the son of Zeus, smiled upon them and said: “Foolish mortals and poor
          drudges are you, that you seek cares and hard toils and straits! Easily will I tell you a
          word and set it in your hearts. <milestone ed="P" n="535" unit="line"/>Though each one of
          you with knife in hand should slaughter sheep continually, yet would you always have
          abundant store, even all that the glorious tribes of men bring here for me. But guard you
          my temple and receive the tribes of men that gather to this place, <milestone ed="P"
            n="539a" unit="line"/>and especially show mortal men my will, and do you keep
          righteousness in your heart. <milestone ed="P" n="539b" unit="line"/>But if any shall be
          disobedient and pay no heed to my warning, <milestone ed="P" n="540" unit="line"/>or if
          there shall be any idle word or deed and outrage as is common among mortal men, then other
          men shall be your masters and with a strong hand shall make you subject for ever. All has
          been told you: do you keep it in your heart.”</p>
        <p><milestone ed="P" n="545" unit="line"/>And so, farewell, son of Zeus and Leto; but I will
          remember you and another hymn also. </p>
